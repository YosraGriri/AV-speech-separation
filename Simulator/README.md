# Room Impulse Response (RIR) Generation using Pyroom Acoustics

## Description

Using this folder, one can generate room impulse responses (RIR) using the Pyroomacoustics library. The main script processes audio sources from specified directories and simulates their acoustics in virtual room environments with defined characteristics.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

## Usage

python main.py --output_path <output_path> --source_dir <source_dir> [other arguments]
for example, to run this on the samples published in the ../data/test folder:
```bash
python Scripts/main.py --source_dir  "../../data/test/raw_audio"    --output_path  "../../data/test/simulated/"
```
To modify and specify specific room parameters, this can be done either by adding them as arguments to the previous bash command or simply editing the default parameters of the room dimension, mic position, and source position.

The source position can either be set manually or by selecting an angle that will be between the source and the center of the mic array.

## File Descriptions of the files in Scripts

- **main.py**:  Parses arguments and initiates the room simulation process.
- **generate_sample_all.py**: Contains the function to generate room simulations for all folders with voice samples.
- **get_voice.py**: Contains functions to extract voice data and associated information from the source directories.
- **plot.py**: Contains a function to visualize the room setup, including sources and microphones.
- **simulate_room.py**: Contains functions to create and configure the room environment for simulations.

The RIR Generation is implemented using the python library Pyroomacoustics.
